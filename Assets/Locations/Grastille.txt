Grastille
Grastille is a sprawling urban center built atop layers of forgotten cities, each buried beneath the one that followed. At the surface, it resembles any modern metropolis: glass towers, crowded trains, endless nightlife. But beneath the flashing billboards and rain-slicked streets, something festers. The city’s infrastructure is aging, and its foundations are riddled with blocked tunnels, hidden sanctuaries, and sealed chambers that predate any public records.

Officially, Grastille is known for its rapid tech growth, international finance sector, and brutal gentrification. Unofficially, it's a battlefield. Vampiric factions move through nightclubs, art galleries, sewers, and rooftop gardens like chess pieces. Every neighborhood has its watchers. Every district carries a different flavor of threat. The city is constantly humming—alive, bleeding, watching.

Some say the city itself has a memory. That it holds grudges. And that something older than the Firstborn is buried far beneath its rusting bones.
