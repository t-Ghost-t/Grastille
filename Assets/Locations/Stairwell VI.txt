Stairwell VI.
In a condemned hospital in Grastille, there is a stairwell that descends nine floors deeper than the building's blueprints allow. Each level is identical, save for flickering emergency lights and the growing sensation of pressure in the ears. The stairs end in a rusted steel door marked only with the Roman numeral six. No attempt has ever succeeded at opening it. The Blackened Order sealed the building in 1998 after the stairwell began appearing in nightmares experienced by nearby residents.
