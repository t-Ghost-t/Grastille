Halden Heights
Perched along the cliffs to the west, Halden Heights was once a retreat for Grastille’s artists and academics. Now it’s a haven for outcasts—writers, musicians, drifters, and those looking to disappear without going far. By day it feels half-forgotten, but by night it lights up: basement bars with no signage, rooftop venues packed with students and freelancers, and late-night galleries that double as after-hours clubs. Live music spills into the streets seven days a week, and it’s not uncommon to see the same face DJing, bartending, and crashing on a couch upstairs. It's a chaotic loop of creation and collapse—and the regulars wouldn't have it any other way.
