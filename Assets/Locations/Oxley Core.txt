Oxley Core
Once part of Grastille’s university system, Oxley Core has evolved into a self-contained innovation sector: part campus, part tech commune, part private city. Electric buses loop through neatly divided zones—Education, Housing, Development. Its parks feature charging stations instead of picnic tables. Entire apartment blocks are subsidized for students and interns with “exceptional potential.” Glass-and-steel towers rise beside neon-lit food halls, giving the place a vibrant, almost utopian feel. But behind the sleek architecture and clean branding, the factions are watching. Young blood, in both senses, runs thick here.
