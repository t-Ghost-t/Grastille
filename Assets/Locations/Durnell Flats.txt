Durnell Flats
A former mill town turned low-income suburb, Durnell Flats has been in slow decay since the textile plants shuttered in the late '80s. Strip malls lie half-empty, their neon signs flickering through broken letters. Locals keep to themselves. Many properties are rented month-to-month, often in cash, and no one asks too many questions. There's a lingering smell of rust and river silt, and most businesses close earlyâ€”not out of fear, but fatigue. A single bus line still connects it to Grastille, though delays are the norm and schedules change without notice.
