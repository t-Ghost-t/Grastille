Caywood Terrace
Caywood Terrace is the closest thing to normal. Middle-class families, chain restaurants, rec centers, and commuter train stops. The streets are quiet after ten, and most homes have solar panels and aging SUVs in the driveways. It’s easy to forget the chaos of Grastille from here—but whispers still carry down the tracks. The local high school has a surprisingly high turnover rate, and the neighborhood association insists on repainting graffiti within 24 hours. Everyone waves—but only from a distance.
