## The Remnants: Eldest Bloodline
*"We do not break oaths. We do not kill our own. And we do not forget."*

### Lore & Backstory
Direct descendants of the Firstborn, the Remnants are bound by ancient laws that dictate every aspect of their existence. They have walked the earth for centuries, either alone or in rare duos, quietly bearing witness to history's rise and fall. The weight of centuries is etched into their souls, and each memory is as vital as the blood that courses through them.

### Feeding Habits
Remnants feed rarely but profoundly, partaking in a unique ritual where the sip is not merely nourishment but communion. Each feeding is a sacred act, a merging of memory, emotion, and lifeforce. The Remnant does not merely drink blood; they absorb the essence of the victim, acquiring fleeting glimpses of their thoughts, dreams, and secrets.

To indulge too deeply is to risk losing oneself, to drown in the lives of others.

### Reproduction
A Remnant may only sire one in their lifetime. The transformation is not an act of violence but a merging, a covenant formed under a solemn moon. This bond is unbreakable.

A Remnant's only true companion is their creator or the one creation they have sired. If their creator perishes, they will wander in mourning, often for centuries, before daring to forge a new bond. The act of creating another is sacred, an extension of one's own existence rather than an expansion of their kind.

### Weaknesses
- **Bound by Ancient Laws:** A Remnant cannot enter a home uninvited, break an oath, step on hallowed ground, or slay another of their kind—even if from a distant bloodline.
- **The Weight of Time:** Their perfect recollection of every moment is a burden. Grief never fades, and mistakes cannot be forgotten.

### Abilities
- **Perfect Recall:** They remember every moment of their existence, granting them knowledge that borders on perfection.
- **Glimpses Beyond:** Vague visions allow them to sense emerging events, likely stemming from pattern recognition across centuries.
- **Mystic Communion:** Their deep feedings let them absorb not only blood but emotions, knowledge, and fragments of another soul.

### Society & Culture
Remnants exist almost entirely in isolation. When they gather, it is in hidden enclaves, ancient ruins, cloistered manors, or forgotten libraries. These gatherings are fleeting, bound by secrecy and reverence.

A Remnant and their bonded companion, if they have one, are the only constants in their existence. For those who travel alone, eternity is a solitary path, one walked with dignity and quiet sorrow.

### Appearance & Distinctions
They are striking, in an otherworldly way—pale yet luminous, with silver eyes that seem to carry the light of long-dead stars. Clad in archaic black garments marked with gilded symbols of their lineage, they exude an air of dignified solitude and timeless mystery.

### The Price of Memory
For the Remnants, their greatest strength is also their deepest curse. The weight of centuries bears down upon them, and some lose themselves in the past, speaking in riddles, forgetting the era in which they live. The oldest among them become like living ghosts, so lost in time they can't be understood by their modern successors.

### The Watchers in the Dark
Despite their isolation, the Remnants have shaped history from the shadows. Some claim they are the keepers of lost languages, forbidden knowledge, and ancient prophecies. They do not rule; they observe, whispering unseen into the currents of fate.

***Their memories are eternal. Their past inescapable. Time is their curse.***
