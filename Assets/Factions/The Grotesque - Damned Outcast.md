## The Grotesque: Damned Outcasts
*"We chose the path of mercy, and for that, we have been forsaken."*

### Lore & Backstory
Not a true bloodline, the Grotesque are the byproduct of vampires who refuse to drink human blood. Over time, their bodies warp, their humanity slipping away as they descend into monstrous forms. Their origins are steeped in sorrow. Once dignified beings, they sacrificed their noble appetites in a desperate bid for redemption or moral purity, only to find that nature would not be denied its due.

### Feeding Habits
They sustain themselves on animal blood but are cursed with extreme hunger. The scent of human blood drives them to the edge of insanity, a constant reminder of what they have renounced and what they crave.

### Reproduction
There is no deliberate siring among the Grotesque. Instead, any vampire who completely forsakes human blood over time inevitably mutates into a Grotesque. Their numbers swell slowly as more of their kind choose or are forced into this path of self-imposed exile.

### Weaknesses
- **Irreversible Mutation:** Once a vampire turns, they can never return to their previous state.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** They burn to ash almost instantly in the sun.
- **Inner Conflict:** The perpetual battle between their lingering human empathy and monstrous instincts often leaves them vulnerable to self-destruction.

### Abilities
- **Gargoyle Physique:** Their skin hardens, and many develop monstrous features—clawed hands, taloned feet, and a nightmarish visage.
- **Regenerative Prowess:** They can endure extreme wounds, regenerating rapidly when well-fed on animal blood.
- **Enhanced Climbing:** Their claws and unnatural strength allow them to scale sheer surfaces, moving unseen along urban landscapes.

### Society & Culture
They tend to live on the fringes of society, forming hidden enclaves in abandoned buildings, underground sewers, or ancient ruins. Within these shadowed communities, debates rage over whether to search for a lost cure to reclaim their lost humanity or to embrace their monstrous destiny as a symbol of defiant honor.

### Appearance & Distinctions
Their bodies bear the marks of their curse—hunched postures, rough, scaled skin, and eyes that burn with a wild, animalistic gleam. They are often shunned by other bloodlines and seen as living pariahs.

### The Hollow Hunger
For the Grotesque, the hunger is more than a physical torment. It is a haunting presence, a cruel voice in their minds. Some claim that in the dead of night, they hear it whispering their names, urging them to heed the call.

### The Question of Redemption
Rumors circulate among their kind of a cure. A way to halt their slow descent into monstrosity. Some say that drinking from a holy relic could restore them. Others believe that the transformation is irreversible and those who seek salvation are only prolonging their suffering.

***Not welcome among the living nor accepted by the damned, they remain in an abyss of their own making.***
