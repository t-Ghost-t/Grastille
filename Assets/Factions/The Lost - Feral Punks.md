## The Lost – Feral Punks
*"We burn, we break, we bleed. Then we do it again."*

### Lore & Backstory
Their bloodline is one that has rotted into obscurity, once powerful, now reduced to festering accidents in forgotten history. The Lost were never meant to exist. They are remnants of something older, something buried. Their past was erased, their legacy shattered, and what remains are the survivors—scraping by in the underbelly of society, clinging to existence through sheer defiance.

Unlike other vampires, their hearts don't stop. They beat—furiously, frantically, a relentless drum of unnatural life. The only way to sustain this is through the consumption of adrenaline-soaked or drug-infused blood. Without it, they begin to "burn out," their bodies consuming themselves in a spiral of violent deterioration.

### Feeding Habits
The Lost crave the rush. They feed best on blood coursing with adrenaline born from combat, fear, reckless passion, or the high of intoxication. Calm or passive prey leaves them weak, but drinking from someone in the throes of violence, ecstasy, or delirium sends them into a euphoric high. Many provoke their victims before feeding, drawing out the perfect cocktail of fear, rage, or reckless joy. The more potent the rush, the longer they can stave off the burn.

### Reproduction
No rituals, no choices. Most Lost are made by accident. A victim survives too many feedings, and something inside them refuses to die. Packs don't recruit; they force newcomers to prove themselves. Those who can't keep up don't last long.

### Weaknesses
- **Burnout:** If they go too long without feeding on adrenaline or drug-infused blood, their overworked hearts give out.
- **Silver Paralysis:** Unlike other vampires, they don't just suffer; they lock up, helpless and rigid.
- **Blood Frenzy:** When hungry, they lose all control, attacking anything that bleeds.
- **Mental Decay:** Few live long in their violent reckless lifestyles. Those who do either burn out or break, unraveling under years of chaos.

### Abilities
- **Blood Rush:** The more wounded they are, the stronger and faster they become.
- **Adrenaline Surge:** Danger fuels them, making them faster, sharper, and deadlier.
- **Predator's Instinct:** They can sense fear, rage, and excitement, leading them to the best prey.

### Society & Culture
The Lost have no hierarchy, only shifting packs and fleeting alliances. They gather in forgotten places: ruined buildings, fight clubs, anywhere the world discards its unwanted. Power is earned through violence, loyalty is rare, and every night is a gamble between survival and destruction.

Elder vampires see them as an embarrassment. Feral, impulsive, and doomed. The Lost don't care. They aren't looking for eternity. They live for the next fight, the next high, the next night that reminds them they're still here.

### Appearance & Distinctions
Tattoos, torn clothes, bloodied knuckles, and wild eyes burning with restless hunger. They don't move like shadowy predators. They move like street brawlers, addicts chasing one last hit, broken things refusing to stop moving. Their bodies are in constant motion, a side effect of their hyperactive hearts.

### The Riot Doctrine
Among the Lost, violence is more than survival—it is a creed. Newcomers are taught that hesitation is death and that the only rule worth following is to never let the fire in their veins grow cold. The longer they live, the more reckless they become, addicted to the rush of conflict and chaos.

### The Myth of the Survivor
Legends whisper of an ancient Lost, one who refused to die. Some say it still roams the world, a god of violence, setting entire cities ablaze to keep its blood rushing. Others claim it found a way to stabilize the decay, creating the first real path to immortality for their kind. Many, however, simply don't care for such tales.

### The Street Hierarchies
Though they claim to have no rulers, the Lost still follow unspoken laws. The strongest fighters, the wildest risk-takers, and the ones with the best connections in the underworld all naturally rise to prominence. Gangs form, break apart, and reassemble in new, more volatile shapes. No alliances last forever, but reputations do.

***They are lost. And they will not be tamed.***
