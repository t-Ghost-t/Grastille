 The Pale Ledger
A nondescript black notebook bound in aged leather, likely [REDACTED] skin, initially found by the Blackened Order during a raid in 1978. Indecipherable circumstances surrounding the book result in it seemingly vanishing from storage at regular intervals. Inside are thousands of names, addresses, and death dates ranging from hundreds of years ago to decades into the futureâ€”most already confirmed accurate. Handwriting analysis suggests multiple authors over decades, possibly centuries. While the source remains unknown, the ledger continues to show signs of being updated whenever it's rediscovered. The last known holder vanished six years ago, in 2019.
