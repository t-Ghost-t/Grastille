The Hollow Pact  
During the rise of the Blackened Order, a few vampires, wracked by guilt or desperate to avoid extinction, sought peace. A pact was struck in blood and silence, lives spared in exchange for secrecy. These vampires fed only from the dying, the willing, or the unwelcome, and in return, the Hunters let them live. It was called the Hollow Pact, and for a brief moment, coexistence seemed possible. But like all things bound by pain and desperation, it could not last. Betrayals on both sides shattered the fragile trust, and the names of those who honored the Pact were lost. Now, whispers say a new generation of vampires and Hunters seeks to restore it. Whether out of idealism—or to buy time for something worse to come—is unclear.
