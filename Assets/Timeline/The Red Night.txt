The Red Night  
Thousands of years ago, during an eclipse known as the Red Night, the first vampires emerged. Stories differ on their originâ€”some say they were humans who discovered a ritual to transcend death, others claim they were touched by forgotten gods, and some believe they were created through ancient blood magic. These beings, later called the Firstborn, possessed godlike powers and existed in a state between life and death.
