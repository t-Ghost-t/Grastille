The Veiled Century
Between 1500 and 1600 CE, vampire society underwent a quiet revolution. For the first time, formal pacts were struck between vampire elders and mortal institutions. Monarchs offered protection in exchange for influence. Churches turned a blind eye for blood-drenched miracles. The Blackened Order emerged, not to destroy vampires, but to police them. It was an age of paradox—religion fueling secrecy, war forging alliances. Many of today’s oldest Silent Treaties trace their origins to this era.
