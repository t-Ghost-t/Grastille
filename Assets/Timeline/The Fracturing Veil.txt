The Fracturing Veil
The Veil was once unbreakable. A shield from the world's eye. Secrets were buried, bodies burned, memories erased. But now, every phone is a camera, every voice can go viral. A grainy video in Varnin. A live feed glitch in Halden Heights. A conspiracy subreddit that almost got it right. The Veil is crackingâ€”not with a bang, but a million whispered questions. The Council issues purges. The Order scrambles to plug leaks. But the dam is breaking. If the Veil falls, the war will no longer be hidden, nobody wants to think about where that may lead.
