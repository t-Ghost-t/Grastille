The Varnin Silence
On July 7th, 2007, all audio recording devices within a three-block radius of Varnin Industrial failedâ€”phones, radios, even analog tape. Surveillance footage shows people in motion and attending their usual activities, their mouths moving eerily in perfect unison. Nobody involved recalls anything unusual about that day or what they may have been saying, only that the day felt unusually long and difficult to remember. The event lasted exactly 7 minutes. No explanation was ever discerned.
