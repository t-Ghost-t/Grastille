The Council of Night
A fractured alliance of vampire elders, the Council of Night exists not to rule, but to preserve. Composed of high representatives from major bloodlines, its purpose is singular: prevent exposure. They meet infrequently, often through intermediaries or encrypted channels. Every major city has at least one operative answering to the Councilâ€”though some act more as observers than enforcers. There is no central authority, only mutual interest. When factions break the rules, the Council doesn't debate. It sets things right.
