The Veiled Century
Between 1500 and 1600 CE, vampire society experienced a subtle upheaval. For the first time, formal pacts were brokered between vampire elders and mortal powers. Kings offered shelter in return for bloody favors. Churches whispered prayers over corpses they knew would rise again to falsify miracles. The Blackened Order was born—not to exterminate vampires, but to regulate them. It was a time of contradictions—holy men shielding monsters, and armies hiring creatures of the night. Many of today’s enduring treaties have roots in the veiled century, forged in candlelit chambers beneath cathedrals and castles alike.
