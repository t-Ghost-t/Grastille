The Forgotten War
Roughly two millennia ago, a catastrophic conflict erupted among the Firstborn and their offspring. What began as ideological fracture became full-scale destruction. Territories burned. Bloodlines vanished. The oldest records were lost or deliberately erased. The warâ€™s survivors formed the first rules of vampiric secrecy. The Choir was born from its ashes, a regulating coalition formed to prevent an event like this from ever occurring again. Today, few besides the elders know that it ever occurred.
