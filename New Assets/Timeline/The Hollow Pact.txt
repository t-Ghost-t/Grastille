The Hollow Pact  
As the influence of the Blackened Order grew in the centuries after the Veiled Century, tensions mounted. Some vampires, burdened by guilt or simply wishing to survive without endless conflict, sought an alternative. A blood-forged agreement was formed in silence—The Hollow Pact. These vampires vowed to feed only from the dying, the desperate, or the outcast. In return, the Order’s Hunters spared their lives. For a fleeting generation, coexistence flickered to life. But pain makes for brittle promises. The pact was fractured by betrayal on both sides, its signatories erased from memory. Yet now, amid whispers of a coming reckoning, there are those—Hunter and vampire alike—who dream of reviving it. Whether from hope or hidden agendas, no one can say.
