The Divergence  
The Firstborn did not remain united. Over time, ideological fractures formed regarding their place in the world and the use of their power. These differences birthed new bloodlines, each carrying fragments of the original curse. Some chose to live as gods among men (the Valthor√©), others became keepers of memory and ritual (the Remnants), while some delved into grotesque or experimental evolutions of vampirism itself.
