New Bellamire
New Bellamire is Grastille's wealthy neighbor—a planned suburban utopia for the elite. Designer homes. Private schools. Gated everything. Beneath the curated charm, the Valthoré thrive. Their influence is cultural here—art auctions, masquerades, high-society galas with blood-red wine. It’s picture-perfect, but unnervingly quiet at night, with security drones replacing neighborhood watches and curated social clubs that subtly screen out the uninvited. Even its parks feel... sterile, like they were designed more for display than for use.
