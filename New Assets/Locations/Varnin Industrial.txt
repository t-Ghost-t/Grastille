Varnin Industrial
Once the engine of Grastille’s economic growth, Varnin is now a post-industrial wasteland of rusted shipping yards, gutted warehouses, and chain-link fences. During the day, truckers and scrap crews move through the emptiness. At night, it belongs to no one. Some factions use it as neutral ground—too exposed to claim, too desolate to watch. Streetlights work sporadically. Cell signal drops for no apparent reason. There’s a convenience store that never closes and never seems to change staff. The rest is steel, silence, and the distant clank of things no one tracks.
