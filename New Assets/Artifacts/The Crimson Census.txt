The Crimson Census  
Long ago, the Valthoré initiated a secret project known as the Crimson Census—a complete record of all known vampires, their bloodlines, feeding patterns, and vulnerabilities. It was a masterwork of espionage and obsession, compiled over centuries through infiltrators and reluctant confessions. The Census was hidden in a vault beneath New Bellamire, accessible only through blood-locked runes. Then it vanished. Some say the Blackened Order stole it. Others claim a rogue Valthoré destroyed it to prevent a civil war. But recently, fragments have begun resurfacing—names, locations, weaknesses—sold on the black market. Each page is priceless. Each one could mean the end of an immortal.
