## The Unwritten: Echoes of the Past
*"Our world is new, but we are the same."*

### Lore & Backstory
The Unwritten are cursed with a cyclical loss of memory. Every full moon, everything they have learned since their turning is erased, resetting them to the person they were in their last remembered moment as a human. For most, this means waking up in a world they do not recognize, surrounded by strangers, with no explanation for how they got there.

Their origin is a punishment from the Firstborn, a sentence passed down for a crime against vampirekind so ancient that even the elders have forgotten its nature. The Unwritten are not simply afflicted. They are condemned. Their existence is a sentence that cannot be appealed, an exile from continuity itself.

Unlike those who carry the burden of eternal memory, the Unwritten are bound to an existence where history cannot hold them. Each cycle strips them of identity, leaving behind only the pieces they manage to preserve.

Some resist complete dissolution. Though their memories fade, remnants of their humanity linger. Those who do not lose themselves entirely to the reset are the tamest among their kind, clinging to faint impressions of who they once were.

### Feeding Habits
The Unwritten are creatures of habit, often returning to the same places, preying on the same people, unknowingly repeating patterns set long before. Some meticulously document their actions, writing down details of their past victims to avoid being caught. Others embrace the reset, feeding on impulse, knowing that whatever they do will be forgotten soon enough.

A small number believe that blood itself might hold the key to memory, attempting to drink only from familiar sources in the hope that something will stick—that a taste might trigger something that endures beyond the next cycle.

### Weaknesses
- **Memory Reset:** Every full moon, they lose all memories gained since their turning, waking up as if no time has passed.
- **Fragmented Identity:** Many develop conflicting personalities as different versions of themselves leave instructions they do not always agree with.
- **Disjointed Loyalty:** An Unwritten cannot form true bonds, only trust what they have written. Some become ruthless pragmatists, relying only on their own notes, while others fall victim to manipulation, believing lies scribbled in their own hand.

### Abilities
- **Instinctive Recognition:** While they forget people, they retain impressions. They get vague feelings of trust, danger, or familiarity when encountering someone they have met before.
- **Subconscious Reflexes:** Though they lose knowledge, their body retains experience. Their vampiric reflexes remain intact.
- **Solar Immunity:** They have an unusual ability to walk in the daylight without any discomfort, helping them blend into regular societies.

### Society & Culture
The Unwritten are viewed as unreliable yet occasionally useful. Some are exploited as disposable operatives, capable of carrying out tasks without remembering who assigned them. Others are pitied, seen as tragic creatures unable to move forward in time.

To counteract their condition, many leave behind detailed records, journals, recordings, or tattoos with simple phrases like "Trust no one" or "Your name is Aleksander." Some develop elaborate personal rituals, reading the same entries every morning to remind themselves of who they are, piecing together fragments of their past to create an artificial sense of self.

If they can learn to trust their notes, some manage to carve out something resembling a normal life. They walk unnoticed among mortals, blending into the world as long as they adhere to the instructions they leave for themselves.

Others give up entirely, living each cycle as if it were their first.

### Appearance & Distinctions
The Unwritten often appear out of place, their clothing and mannerisms frozen in the era of their turning. Some wear modern attire over outdated styles, blending practicality with an unconscious clinging to the past. Many have tattoos or jewelry marked with reminders, messages scrawled in their own hand that they must re-learn every month.

Their eyes carry a peculiar emptiness, not the weight of age but the hollowness of someone who never truly moves forward.

### The Question of Persistence
Most Unwritten lose everything with the cycle. But every now and then, one of them remembers something. A name. A place. A single moment that refuses to fade.

No one knows why.

Some believe it is proof that their curse is not absolute, that memory is not erased but buried, waiting for the right trigger. Others believe that something has gone wrong in the cycle—that they are breaking down, their minds unraveling as fragments of past lives bleed into the present.

The elder vampires whisper of those who have tried to hold on, who fought the reset and won. But none can say what became of them. No record remains.

***They have lived a thousand lives, yet they only remember one.***
