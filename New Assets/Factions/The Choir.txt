## The Choir – Whisperers in the Night
*"We do not lead. We endure."*

### Lore & Backstory
Formed after a forgotten war, the Choir is a fractured alliance of ancient vampire elders united by one cause—preservation. They do not seek power or domination, only secrecy. In a world teetering on exposure, they remain the last barrier between vampire society and the all-seeing eyes of modern surveillance.

The Choir is composed of high representatives from the major bloodlines. They are not rulers but stewards. Their meetings are rare, conducted through proxies or encrypted channels. Internal conflict is frequent, but one rule is never broken: **no one reveals the truth**.

### Purpose
The Choir exists to uphold the masquerade. They intervene only when vampire existence risks exposure—whether by internal squabbles, external threats, or careless breaches. Inaction is their norm. But when they move, they do so with absolute finality.

### Structure
- No formal leadership; power shifts with bloodline strength, accumulated favors, and sheer influence.
- The Council is a rotating seat of elders from different lineages.
- Agents, known as *Choir Operatives*, are embedded in cities to observe, influence, and, when needed, fix.

### Rules
- **Exposure is death.** For individuals or entire covens.
- **Council decisions are final.** No appeals, no exceptions.
- **Factions may feud, but not in public.**
- **Mortals must remain unaware. Always.**

### Tactics
- Operate from the shadows, never the spotlight.
- Influence governments, manipulate data, erase surveillance.
- Use misinformation, diplomacy, and when necessary—total erasure.
- Encourage proxy wars to avoid open conflict.

### Society & Culture
Every major city hosts at least one Operative. They rarely enforce. They watch. They nudge. Sometimes, they disappear threats.

Within the Choir, influence is a currency, respect is earned in blood, and reputation is everything. Outsiders mistake them for bickering aristocrats. Insiders know better—when the Choir sings, it ends in silence.

### Appearance & Distinctions
In mortal society, Operatives blend seamlessly—executives, bureaucrats, priests. Nothing flashy. During clandestine meetings, they wear black garb and veiled masks unique to their bloodlines—bandanas, visors, or sculpted faceplates. Anonymity is sacred.

### The Doctrine of the Veil
The Choir teaches restraint. They are not warriors, but archivists and maintainers of the old ways. Violence is a last resort. But when the Veil is torn, they do not argue. They remove the problem—quietly, permanently.

### The Myth of the Black Accord
An unconfirmed tale whispers of a hidden pact made at the Choir's founding. Supposedly, it bound all bloodlines to a singular fate: exposure of one becomes the fall of all. Whether myth or truth, the fear it inspires is real—and effective.

***They are the unseen. The unspoken. The last line between secrecy and extinction.***
