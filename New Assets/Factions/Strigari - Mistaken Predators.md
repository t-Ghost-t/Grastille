## Strigari: Mistaken Predators
*"Neither cursed nor blessed. Simply the next step."*

### Lore & Backstory
Unlike vampires born of the Firstborn, Strigari are living predators—stronger, faster, and deadlier than humans, but bound by flesh rather than immortality. Their origins are unclear, with theories ranging from forgotten experiments to an undiscovered offshoot of humanity. Unlike true vampires, they are not undead; they breathe, feel pain, and can die like any other creature.

The world often mistakes them for vampires, and many Strigari take advantage of this, allowing fear and superstition to shield them from true scrutiny. Their existence is an unsettling reminder that not all predators lurk in the shadows of myth—some walk among humans in plain sight, indistinguishable until it is too late.

Vampires regard them with a mixture of disdain and hostility. Some see them as crude imitations, while others recognize the threat they pose—a rival predator unburdened by curses or ancient bloodlines. This tension has sparked conflicts throughout history, with whispers of brutal wars fought between the old and the new.

### Feeding Habits
Strigari do not require blood but grow stronger temporarily when they drink it. The more they consume, the more powerful they become—but also the more uncontrollable. Unlike vampires, they can eat flesh, and many prefer to consume their prey entirely.

### Reproduction
Under normal circumstances, Strigari reproduce naturally, giving birth to their own kind. Their offspring mature rapidly, growing into full hunters within a few years. Some live in loose family groups, but most eventually go solitary.

However, there exists a rare and gruesome method by which a human can be reborn. If a human consumes the raw, still-warm heart of a Strigari, they may undergo a violent transformation over days or weeks. Their body twists, their senses sharpen, and their hunger shifts toward flesh and blood.

Most lose themselves to madness before the change is complete. For those who survive, the transformation is permanent. They will never be human again... but they will hunt.

### Weaknesses
- **Mortal Vulnerability:** They lack supernatural regeneration—wounds heal at a normal rate unless blood is consumed to speed the process. A bullet or blade can kill them like any other creature.
- **Bloodlust Overload:** Drinking too much blood triggers uncontrollable savagery, risking loss of rationality.
- **Instinctual Hunger:** Unlike vampires, Strigari must consume large quantities of fresh meat regularly or grow weak.

### Abilities
- **Predatory Surge:** Drinking blood briefly enhances their physical abilities, but the effect fades quickly.
- **Unhinging Maw:** Their jaw can stretch unnaturally, allowing them to bite deeply or consume large chunks of flesh.
- **Enhanced Physiology:** Naturally stronger and faster than humans, their bodies are built for the hunt.

### Society & Culture
Strigari blend into human society, but only as observers, never truly part of it. Their instincts drive them to hunt, not to rule or manipulate. They may walk unnoticed among humans, but their presence is always felt when the hunt begins. Unlike vampires, who seduce and manipulate their prey, Strigari rely on fear, their transformations unleashing raw, primal terror in those who witness them.

Some become urban predators, preying on the weak in the underbelly of cities. Others live on the fringes, deep in forests, mountains, or wastelands where their kind can roam freely. Their approach to survival is neither political nor ritualistic—it is simply instinct.

### Appearance & Distinctions
They appear human until they attack. When they strike, their limbs and ears elongate, their joints stretch unnaturally, and their jaw unhinges to reveal rows of needle-like teeth. Unlike vampires, who ensnare their prey with unnatural beauty, a Strigari's presence is heralded by something far more visceral—dread.

### The Breeding Grounds
Unlike true vampires, the Strigari do not sire—they are born. Hidden enclaves exist where their kind raise their young, training them in the art of the hunt. Some operate in rural wildernesses, where they can hunt freely. Others live in cities, teaching their children to blend in, to hide in plain sight until the moment they strike.

### The Blood Wars
There are whispers of past conflicts where the Strigari attempted to challenge the ancient bloodlines. Their attempts were brutal but short-lived. They lack the subtlety of the old blood, their hunger too wild, their methods too reckless. However, some believe another war is coming, one where the Strigari may finally learn to outlast their enemies.

### The Forgotten Origins
No one truly knows where the first Strigari came from. Some believe they were a failed experiment—an attempt to create a vampire immune to the weaknesses of the Firstborn. Others think they are a natural evolution, a predator born to replace those who walk among us now.

Among their own, the oldest tell stories of a single progenitor, a creature neither dead nor alive, waiting to be found.

***They are evolution. A predator unbound by the curse of death.***
