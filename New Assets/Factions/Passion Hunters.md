## Passion Hunters: Damaged & Driven
*"Every scar is a testament to my resolve."*

### Lore & Backstory
Passion Hunters are not an organization, a movement, or a secret society. They are individuals, isolated and alone, bound only by personal loss. Each has suffered an encounter with a vampire that shattered their lives, leaving behind nothing but grief and a desperate need for answers. Some seek revenge, others justice, and a rare few fight simply to ensure no one else endures what they have.

### Methods & Training
They teach themselves through necessity, scavenging knowledge from obscure books, whispered rumors, or sheer trial and error. Some fashion crude weapons, others steal from crime scenes or black-market suppliers. A few turn to old folklore, trusting in tactics passed down by frightened ancestors.

Their methods are erratic. One might spend years tracking a single vampire, obsessively collecting evidence, while another lashes out in blind rage, burning down a suspected lair without certainty of its inhabitants.

### Society & Culture
Passion Hunters rarely cross paths. When they do, it is almost always by chance. A brief exchange of warnings, a tense truce in a dark alley, or an uneasy alliance that lasts just long enough to take down a shared enemy. They do not form networks, nor do they follow any set of unwritten rules. Each operates according to their personal motivations and their own interpretation of what must be done.

### Limitations & Perspective
Most Passion Hunters don't realize the scale of what they're fighting. They think their enemy is singular, a monster in the night. A simple creature that stole their life, not part of an ancient tangled web stretching across centuries. They do not see the bigger picture, and most wouldn't understand it if they did.

### The Ones Who Live
Most Passion Hunters burn out or succumb to the challenge they set for themselvesâ€”too reckless and too broken to last. But a few survive, adapt, and overcome. They move like shadows, hunting with an efficiency that even elder vampires respect. These few are whispered about in fear. Less predictable than the organized militias of The Blackened Order, but every bit as dangerous.

### The Hunt Never Ends
For a Passion Hunter, there is no "after." Even if their revenge is complete, even if they destroy the creature that ruined them, the emptiness remains. Some turn to hunting all vampires. Others simply vanish, unable to return to a normal life. A few, it is said, go too far, becoming monsters themselves.

***Their rage is unrelenting. Their wounds never heal. They are drawn to a war they may never truly win.***
