## Factions

### Passion Hunters
Isolated individuals driven by personal loss from vampire encounters, Passion Hunters are self-taught vampire slayers who operate alone with erratic methods. Most don't understand the full scope of the vampire world, and even if they achieve their revenge, they remain haunted and unable to return to normal life.

### The Grotesque
The Grotesque are vampires who refuse to drink human blood, leading their bodies to warp into monstrous forms with gargoyle-like features and animal blood dependence. These outcasts live on society's fringes, debating whether to seek redemption or embrace their monstrous nature, forever caught between humanity and true vampirism.

### The Blackened Order
The Blackened Order is a clandestine paramilitary organization descended from the Knights Templar, systematically hunting vampires with advanced technology and centuries of knowledge. Their operatives sacrifice normal lives to fight vampires from the shadows, with some veterans developing disturbing abilities from prolonged exposure to vampire blood.

### Strigari
The Strigari are living predators often mistaken for vampires, with enhanced strength and speed but not true immortality. These evolutionary hunters can reproduce naturally or transform humans who consume their hearts, blending into society while hunting with terrifying transformations and instinctual violence.

### The Valthoré
The Valthoré are aristocratic vampires who have influenced human civilization since ancient times, consuming only "exquisite" blood from noble or talented individuals. They maintain their power through blood alchemy, hypnotic influence, and ritualistic siring, while their obsession with perfection and luxury leads to silent wars among rival cabals.

### The Unwritten
Cursed with cyclical memory loss every full moon, The Unwritten are vampires who reset to their last human memories, forcing them to leave notes and recordings to maintain any sense of self. Some exploit their condition for consequence-free actions, while others develop elaborate systems to function in society, with rare instances of memories persisting between cycles.

### The Remnants
Direct descendants of the Firstborn, The Remnants are ancient vampires bound by strict laws who feed through sacred communion, absorbing not just blood but memories and emotions. Each may only sire one companion in their lifetime, bearing the burden of perfect recall that makes them both formidable and isolated, their eternal memories becoming both power and curse.

### The Lost
The Lost are feral vampire outcasts with frantically beating hearts that require adrenaline-soaked or drug-infused blood to prevent burning out. These chaotic survivors form loose packs in society's forgotten places, growing stronger when wounded, thriving on danger, and living for the next fight rather than eternity.

## Events

### The Fracturing Veil
The secrecy protecting vampires from public discovery is breaking in the modern era as digital technology makes concealment increasingly difficult. The Council of Night and Blackened Order struggle to contain leaks while facing the possibility of an open war if the Veil fully collapses.

### The Veiled Century
During 1500-1600 CE, vampire society established formal pacts with human institutions like monarchies and churches, creating the foundation for modern vampire-human relations. This period also saw the emergence of the Blackened Order and the creation of many Silent Treaties that still govern vampire existence.

### The Council of Night
A fragmented alliance of vampire elders representing major bloodlines, the Council exists solely to prevent the exposure of vampires to humanity. Operating through intermediaries and local operatives in major cities, they act as enforcers rather than rulers when their rules of secrecy are broken.

### The Forgotten War
Approximately two millennia ago, a devastating conflict erupted among the Firstborn vampires and their descendants, resulting in destroyed territories and vanished bloodlines. The survivors established the first rules of vampiric secrecy and formed the Council of Night, with knowledge of the war now limited to the eldest vampires.

### Fraying Accord
The traditional power structures and rules governing vampire society are unraveling as old bloodlines die out and new factions rise. The Hidden War between vampire factions is shifting from a cold war to open conflict as ancient laws and traditions face increasing rebellion.

### The Hollow Pact
A brief peace was established between some vampires and the Blackened Order hunters, where vampires would feed only from the dying or willing in exchange for being allowed to live. This pact eventually collapsed due to betrayals on both sides, though rumors suggest some are trying to revive the agreement.

### The Varnin Silence
On July 7th, 2007, all audio recording devices within part of Varnin Industrial mysteriously failed for exactly 7 minutes, while surveillance footage showed people speaking in unison, though no one remembers what happened. The inexplicable event remains unexplained.

### The Divergence
The Firstborn vampires separated due to ideological differences about their place in the world, creating distinct bloodlines with different philosophies and powers. This fragmentation led to various vampire types, from the aristocratic Valthoré to the memory-keeping Remnants and experimental offshoots.

### The Red Night
The first vampires, known as the Firstborn, emerged during an ancient eclipse called the Red Night. Origin stories vary between ritual transcendence, divine intervention, or blood magic, but all agree these original vampires possessed godlike powers in a state between life and death.

## Locations

### Oxley Core
A transformed university district that has become a self-contained innovation sector with education zones, subsidized housing, and technology development areas. Its sleek, utopian appearance masks the interest of vampire factions drawn to the concentration of young talent and fresh blood.

### Varnin Industrial
An abandoned industrial zone of Grastille with rusted shipping yards and gutted warehouses that becomes a lawless no-man's-land at night. Various vampire factions use it as neutral ground due to its isolation, while mysterious occurrences like signal drops and a never-closing convenience store contribute to its eerie atmosphere.

### New Bellamire
An affluent planned suburb for the elite featuring designer homes, private schools, and gated communities where the Valthoré vampires exercise cultural influence through high-society events. Despite its perfect appearance, the neighborhood maintains unsettling quiet and sterility.

### Halden Heights
A cliff-side district that evolved from an academic retreat to a haven for artists, musicians, and those seeking to disappear. By day it appears forgotten, but at night it transforms with underground bars, rooftop venues, and galleries-turned-clubs in a perpetual cycle of creative energy and collapse.

### Durnell Flats
A decaying former mill town turned low-income suburb with half-empty strip malls and cash-based rental properties where residents keep to themselves. Connected to Grastille by an unreliable bus line, the area carries the lingering smell of rust and river silt with businesses closing early out of fatigue.

### Caywood Terrace
A seemingly normal middle-class neighborhood with quiet streets, chain restaurants, and commuter train access that maintains a facade of suburban normalcy. Beneath the surface, high school staff turnover and aggressive graffiti removal hint at underlying connection to Grastille's darker elements.

### Grastille
A sprawling metropolis built atop layers of forgotten cities, combining modern urban features with aging infrastructure and ancient sealed chambers. Officially known for technology and finance, it serves as a secret battlefield for vampire factions while rumors suggest something older than the Firstborn lies buried beneath the city.

### Stairwell VI
A mysterious stairwell in a condemned Grastille hospital that descends nine floors deeper than architectural plans allow, ending at an unopenable steel door marked with the Roman numeral six. The Blackened Order sealed the building in 1998 after nearby residents began experiencing nightmares related to the stairwell.
